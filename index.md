### First Year Seminar - Drake University - Fall 2024

### Welcome to Aesthetics of Computation. Please make sure to read the entirety of the syllabus below.

# We have one mission this semester: to analyze the vibes of all things computing-related. 

That umbrella is a big one. 

We will talk about the hacker aesthetic, AI-generated images, computer music, and many other topics.

We're also going to learn some philosophy, so that we have more tools for thinking about these things.
