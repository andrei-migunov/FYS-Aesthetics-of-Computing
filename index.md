# COURSE OBJECTIVES
## We have one mission this semester: to analyze the vibes of all things computing-related. That's a pretty big umbrella.

Some of our topics: the hacker aesthetic, AI-generated images, computer music, aesthetic theory, gaming, and many more.

Some of our philosophical questions: what is beauty and how does it manifest in the design of computers and related things? why do themes like cyberpunk and hacking have such draw? how is understanding something aesthetically related to understanding its function? how does it go beyond? what do we mean in philosophy by 'form' and 'content'? how do the appearances of things affect how we understand those things? what is the nature of the appeal of electronic and other 'computer music'? what do machines and technology make us feel in art that utilizes those themes? what is a video game?

# ATTENDANCE

You are expected to attend every class. Two absences are excused by default. Any absences beyond the first two must be documented. For that reason, it's actually better to document all your absences - to avoid having to use up the 'freebies'. Documenting your absence means having some proof that your absences was a valid one - doctor, job interview, etc. Not every absence can be or needs to be documented (e.g. - I do not require documentation for absence due to the passing of a loved one, which unfortunately happens.) These absences are 'covered' by the two 'free' absences.

Attendance is part of the 'engagement' portion of your grade. Please see the 'grading' page of the course website for more detail.
