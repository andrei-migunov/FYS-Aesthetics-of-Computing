# COURSE OBJECTIVES
## We have one mission this semester: to analyze the vibes of all things computing-related. That's a pretty big umbrella. That means we have to narrow it down to a collection of things that we can talk about in one semester.

Some of our topics: the hacker aesthetic, computer music, aesthetic theory, gaming, pixel and AI art, and many more.

Some of our questions: What is a computer? Is it a machine? What is beauty and how does it manifest in the design of computers and related things? Why do themes like cyberpunk and hacking have such appeal? How is understanding something aesthetically related to understanding its function? How does it go beyond? What do we mean in philosophy by 'form' and 'content'? How do the appearances of things affect how we understand those things? What is the nature of the appeal of electronic and other 'computer music'? What do artistic representations of machines and technology make us feel? What is a video game? How does nostalgia for the past affect how we think and feel about technologies?

When you go to look at the schedule linked above - you might think an important topic, reading, idea, or even particular aesthetic object (a song, picture, movie) is missing. If so, tell me! Convince me it matters, and it'll become part of the class!

# READING, VIEWING, AND LISTENING

Reading is a major part of this course, possibly the most important part. Reading does not mean simply parsing the words on the page. It means thinking carefully in order to understand their meaning. This is a basic responsibility and cannot be waived. It is *your* job to understand our readings, they cannot be 'digested' *for* you. If you don't try your absolute best to understand them, then we cannot discuss them. You will read material that is challenging, and you might see words you are not familiar with. It is your responsibility to look them up. That said, don't get hung up on everything all the time. Exercise your best judgment to decide how you read, when you really need to look something up, when it's an inessential thing you can skip over at least for now, etc. Read slowly and carefully, and always read the entire assigned reading. When you finish reading something, rephrase it in your own words to yourself. Sometimes you can't do that on the first pass, and you need to take another look.  

Some days, in addition to reading, we will watch movies or videos, or look at some art, or listen to some music. In some ways, this is "reading," too. It requires focus, care, and an attempt to <i>experience</i> those things and <i>understand</i> the claims they make. I expect you to do your best. Part of the fun of this class is comparing how you "read" such things <i> aesthetically </i> to how others do.

# WRITING

We could have a whole semester course on just the question: "what is writing?". For now, let's just stick with what our writing should *do*. 

We write for others and for ourselves. We can write to lay out and better organize our own (often jumbled and confused) ideas and thoughts. This fits with our 'low-stakes' writing assignments, and personal journaling: we use these to get a grasp on what we're thinking and feeling. We can write to convince others of a claim or really flesh out a coherent feeling or experience, to resolve contradictions in our thoughts and beliefs where they don't naturally line up that well - this fits with the high-stakes writing assignments. Lastly, we can write with even greater ambition - to put an idea or a claim in the most "honest light," to defend an idea thoroughly and convince others of it, to show ourselves and others the full richness and force of an artistic or other experience. This is the final product of our writing at the end of the semester - the final paper. Whether we write for others or for ourselves, writing makes us better, more accountable people and helps us see more clearly. Good writing tries to show us something new, tries to anticipate what our readers might already think, tries to explain ideas more clearly than they've been explained before, among other things. It goes well beyond academic and persuasive writing. There are a lot of things good writing can do, and you can shoot for any combination of them. Write the kinds of things you'd want to read - find not just your voice, but the shape of that voice and find out what kind of writer you want to be. 

But with that in mind, know that one main goal in this class is to become better, clearer, and more able to communicate ideas to other people so that they understand them.


# ATTENDANCE

You are expected to attend every class. Two absences are excused by default (for these, you do not have to ask me or let me know you will be gone). Any absences beyond the first two must be documented. For that reason, it's actually better to document <i>all</i> of your absences - to avoid having to use up the 'freebies'. Documenting your absence means having some proof that your absences was a valid one - illness, job interview, etc. Proof is any clear evidence that you are gone for the reason you say - a doctor's note with a date and reason for visit, an interview letter that shows the date of your interview, etc. Not every absence can be or needs to be documented (e.g. - I do not require documentation for absence due to the passing of a loved one, which unfortunately happens.) These absences are 'covered' by the two 'free' absences. You are always welcome to communicate with me about your attendance needs, and I am always willing to hear you out.

Attendance is part of the 'engagement' portion of your grade and unexcused absences will negatively affect your grade. Please see the 'grading' page of the course website for more detail.

# OFFICE HOURS

Office hours are a time to talk to the professor, get clarification, ask questions, talk through ideas and concepts, solve problems, etc. You are welcome at my office hours and I'd love to see you there. My office hours are always in Collier-Scripps Room 321. I can also set office hours by appointment - so if you *can't make it* to the standard office hours, please email me and let's set up a time! I promise it's no inconvenience - and time spent in office hours can be very rewarding!

My office hours this semester are:

Mondays from 2pm-4pm,
Tuesdays from 2pm-4pm,
or by appointment

# THE AVERAGE DAY OF CLASS

Class time consists of discussion, writing, and looking back at selected passages from the readings. It is <b> not </b> the place to do the reading assignments (these have to be compelted <b> before </b> class). 

In discussions, I will usually give you some questions to think about, and you'll talk to each other in small groups and spend some time writing individually. Then we'll see if we can sometimes make real progress on answering those questions in class. 

After some discussion, I will give you some time to work on your writing. You'll submit these assignments on our course Blackboard page.

# GUIDELIES FOR DISCUSSION, READING, AND THIS CLASS IN GENERAL

0. <b>Respectful disagreement</b>: There is a 0% chance that we will all agree on everything, including things we feel strongly about. You can believe your beliefs, even be certain of them, and still be unable to change anyone's mind. That does not mean you can resort to any sort of rude behavior or name-calling. It is absolutely out of the question. You must be respectful of your classmates. From the other side - sometimes another person's belief looks like a direct assault on ours (sometimes it is). We have to make an effort to accept others' shortcomings (whether it's that they are wrong (!!!) or aren't being particularly gentle) with grace and patience. 

1. <b>Safety</b>: Please come to the instructor with any serious interpersonal problems - I am always happy to hear you out and talk, and I will take any serious issues seriously. If you have a concern, especially regarding your safety or someone else's, please reach out to me to discuss it privately.

2. <b>Studying the debate</b>: Not all questions need or have definitive answers. They need to be thought about and "chewed" thoroughy. Our goal is to see things in new, different, and interesting ways, and to understand aesthetics. That means sitting with a question for a while. It also means that in some ways, it's more interesting - and a surer sign of maturity and knowledge - to study the debates and different viewpoints, rather than taking a once-and-for-all position. 

3. <b>Do the reading</b>: The quality of discussion is proportional to the care with which you did the reading. If most people did not read the text very closely, or did not take good notes on it and think about it, then we aren't going to be able to have a quality discussion. 

4. <b>Use of class time</b>: During class time you must be focused and listening to others in the room. 

# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

All students are expected to know and abide by the <a href="https://www.drake.edu/studentlife/handbook-resources/handbook/academic/">Drake University Academic Integrity Policy (click here to read)</a>.


Students are encouraged to seek out resources for help in understanding concepts when completing coursework. However, there is a big difference between seeking outside resources for help in understanding and searching for solutions. All solutions prepared with the aid of any source, however minor, must specifically cite those sources and explain the relationship of the submitted solution to the source. All citations must include author names, titles, publication information, and links to electronic sources when they exist. For programming code, all such citations and explanations should be included with comments. When in doubt, be open and transparent about the use of sources. This will shift the issue away from a question of academic integrity penalties to a question of how many points to award for your contributions. A violation of the course's collaboration policy will also be considered an academic integrity violation.

The minimum penalty for any violation of academic integrity will be a forfeiture of all points on the entire assignment or exam in question. Depending on the severity of the violation, an `F' for the course may be given. All violations will be reported to the College of Arts and Sciences Dean's office as explained in the Academic Integrity Policy.

# STUDENT DISABILITY SERVICES
If you have a disability and require academic or physical accommodations in this course, please contact me and Student Disability Services (Michelle Laughlin, Director of Student Disability Services, at 271-1835 or michelle.laughlin@drake.edu) in advance of the date the accommodations are needed. Student Disability Services will coordinate with me to ensure that the necessary accommodations are provided. <b>You must meet with me at least two weeks before an exam to discuss your accommodation, even if you have already received this accommodation from SDS.</b>

# A NOTE
The instructor reserves the right to modify this syllabus along with any course policies at any time during the semester.
