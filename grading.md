# ASSIGNMENTS AND DUE DATES

Everything due in this class is due on a Friday.  

These are general descriptions of the nature of each assignment type. The assignments themselves will be made available on 

## LOW STAKES ASSIGNMENTS

Low stakes assignments exist so that you can practice writing and get feedback, without any cost to your grade. Low stakes assignments are graded based on whether or not you attempted them at all. However, you need to use them to try to improve and you need to incorporate feedback on low stakes assignments into your high stakes assignments. You can be informal in these assignments, and you should use them as opportunities to get your ideas and your reactions to others' ideas out onto paper.

## HIGH STAKES ASSIGNMENTS

Good writing is good thinking. High stakes assignments exist to actually assess and grade your writing quality, and also the quality of your own thinking about the material you're writing about - other than the final paper, they're the main source of your grade points. You need to do your best on them, and write thoughtful, clean, quality work that shows that you've digested the ideas and spent time with them one-on-one. You need to express and defend your ideas, support them with evidence, and cite your sources. These are all things you should be trying to do in low stakes assignments as well, but on high stakes assignments they earn (or cost) you points. You canâ€™t fully engage with an idea, theme, or problem until you, yourself, write about it and commit your best thoughts to paper.

## WRITING CONVERSATION ASSIGNMENT
The Writing Center is helpful for all students and it is not a sign of weakness to visit and work with someone one-on-one. You should set up an appointment with one of their student employees and work with them on any writing assignments you like. Make an appointment, visit them, and you will get the points for this assignment.

You can make your appointment here: <a href=https://library.drake.edu/writing-center/>Drake Writing Center</a>.

## PROPOSAL FOR A FINAL PAPER IDEA

You must propose (to the instructor) a topic on which you will write at length (6-8 pages). The proposal itself can be fairly short - about half a page. It must discuss some of the main points you might hit in your paper, but of course you don't need to have spelled them all out to yourself in detail yet.

## FINAL PAPER



The centerpiece of your writing is the final paper. It should be an original contribution - something nobody has done before - to the topic described in your proposal.

This paper cannot simply repeat discussions from class. If it uses those ideas, you must 

1. Credit the course discussions 
2. Significantly develop them into something more sophisticated, complex, and multifaceted. 

You are welcome to weave together different threads of thought, but make sure to avoid simply re-treading a lot of old ground without adding much new. 

The final paper must be 6-8 pages, double-spaced. If you want to write more, you must talk to me first.

# LATE WORK AND EXTENSIONS

No late work is accepted whatsoever. 

You may request an extension of <b> two </b> extra days for an assignment, but only by following the rules below:

Extensions on assignments can be requested, and I am generally happy to grant them. What matters to me is that you have a <b> plan  </b> for completing your work and that you can follow through on it. That said, I cannot in good conscience allow your assignments to pile up via extensions. This is a recipe for failure. Thus, extensions will typically be short - but can be granted as often as needed.

Every extension must be requested over email, and every such email must have the following subject line: <b> AOC EXT REQ: HW (number) </b> $$ I will ignore any email that does not have this subject line. I will ignore every request that comes later than 24 hours <b> before </b> the due date: you must request an extension at least 24 hours before the due date. To do this, you must be paying attention to your own progress on each assignment, and start early.





<!-- I will grade your grammar and spelling, to a certain extent. It is not an insult - I want to help you write better and more clearly.

I will point out mistakes once per submission, and after that I will deduct for them without pointing them out. For example, if you write "then" instead of "than" (in a situation where that's wrong), I'll say something - but I won't keep pointing this out and cover your essay in red marker. I expect you to learn the lesson and improve, or ask me if you're not sure what I'm getting at. -->
