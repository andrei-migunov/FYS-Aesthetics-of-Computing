TBD

<!-- I will grade your grammar and spelling, to a certain extent. It is not an insult - I want to help you write better and more clearly.

I will point out mistakes once per submission, and after that I will deduct for them without pointing them out. For example, if you write "then" instead of "than" (in a situation where that's wrong), I'll say something - but I won't keep pointing this out and cover your essay in red marker. I expect you to learn the lesson and improve, or ask me if you're not sure what I'm getting at. -->
