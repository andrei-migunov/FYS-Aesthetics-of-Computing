## WRITING CONVERSATION ASSIGNMENT
The Writing Center is helpful for all students and it is not a sign of weakness to visit and work with someone one-on-one. You should set up an appointment with one of their student employees and work with them on any writing assignments you like. Make an appointment, visit them, and you will get the points for this assignment.

You can make your appointment here: <a href=https://library.drake.edu/writing-center/>Drake Writing Center</a>

# LATE WORK AND EXTENSIONS

No late work is accepted whatsoever. 

You may request an extension of <b> two </b> extra days for an assignment, but only by following the rules below:

Extensions on assignments can be requested, and I am generally happy to grant them. What matters to me is that you have a <b> plan  </b> for completing your work and that you can follow through on it. That said, I cannot in good conscience allow your assignments to pile up via extensions. This is a recipe for failure. Thus, extensions will typically be short - but can be granted as often as needed.

Every extension must be requested over email, and every such email must have the following subject line: <b> AOC EXT REQ: HW (number) </b> $$ I will ignore any email that does not have this subject line. I will ignore every request that comes later than 24 hours <b> before </b> the due date: you must request an extension at least 24 hours before the due date. To do this, you must be paying attention to your own progress on each assignment, and start early.





<!-- I will grade your grammar and spelling, to a certain extent. It is not an insult - I want to help you write better and more clearly.

I will point out mistakes once per submission, and after that I will deduct for them without pointing them out. For example, if you write "then" instead of "than" (in a situation where that's wrong), I'll say something - but I won't keep pointing this out and cover your essay in red marker. I expect you to learn the lesson and improve, or ask me if you're not sure what I'm getting at. -->
