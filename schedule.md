>"What does a scanner see? he asked himself. I mean, really see? Into the head? Down into the heart? Does a passive infrared scanner like they used to use or a cube-type holo-scanner like they use these days, the latest thing, see into me - into us - clearly or darkly? I hope it does, he thought, see clearly, because I can't any longer these days see into myself. I see only murk. Murk outside; murk inside. I hope, for everyone's sake, the scanners do better. Because, he thought, if the scanner sees only darkly, the way I myself do, then we are cursed, cursed again and like we have been continually, and we'll wind up dead this way, knowing very little and getting that little fragment wrong too." (Philip K. Dick, <i> A Scanner Darkly </i>)

# Doing the reading

First-year seminars tend to read about 25 pages per day. That number is an average - which means some days we read more and other days we read less. There will be days of class for which we need to read closer to 50 pages, and days of class where the entire reading is half a page. It's hard to have anything to say (or to write) if a person doesn't read very much. Good ideas come from the way we process the ideas of others, and this is a list of readings that will give you new ideas to make your own ideas and writing original and interesting to other people and to yourself.

<b>It is not possible to do well in this class without doing the reading. </b>

Our detailed schedule of readings is below. Any reading that is not hyperlinked is available in Blackboard - so you should go there and download it.

Supplementary readings are <i>optional</i> and you are not required to read them, though you are encouraged to!


# Assignments

All assignments are posted <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qB1QgjPhYQgD4gCDe4W9ovCVcv8H1Q3d5pW-EZvuu_Y/edit?usp=sharing">here (click)</a>. Remember you can only access that page with your @drake.edu email account. The expectations of the assignments are described on the 'Grading' page.

# Detailed Schedule

Topic: Welcome to Drake!
Reading for this day: (Nothing for the first day - but read the course syllabus for next time, and start on the readings for next week)


____________________________________


Aug 27 |

Reading for this day: The course syllabus (this entire website - yes, all of it, starting from the main page), and the [Drake Academic Honest Policy (College of Arts and Sciences)](https://www.drake.edu/studentlife/handbook-resources/handbook/academic/) 

Skimming it is not very useful, as you are on the hook for understanding all of it. So take your time and read carefully - it's the only reading for this week.

Please take the syllabus quiz on Blackboard by the end of this week!

Working on papers in class together.

We'll sit down together to look at how your paper's coming along. Some of your score will come from showing me on this day that you've made good progress towards your paper's completion, that you've sharpened your ideas and have a clear concept of what you're trying to do. Good time to ask me last-minute questions, clarifications, etc. before the due date. Office hours are also a good time for that. I will expect your FINAL versions next week! 

____________________________________

No meeting during finals week. You've learned a lot and worked plenty hard - put the finishing touches on it all and submit a quality project, meeting all of the specified criteria, to me by TBD.

Next time:

Giger as an application of mechtech (day after mechtech but also after biotech)
Biotech as an aestehtic category (after cyberpunk? before?)
Remove coding day, or combine with hacking
Viruses and virality? 

General improvements:
-I need to talk less and give away the plot less. Let them handle the easy questions. 
-Need to encourage students *very clearly* to stay away from the 'low hanging fruit' of boring ethical observations like "AI is bad". Need to push them to focus on the aesthetics and pull ethics out of that.
- Personal writing is encouraged but it has to be engaging. I need to actually take off points for personal anecdotes that don't include any insights.
- Emphasizing content over form was a good idea - and it's challenging. I should keep on that thread.
- Need to continue to be harsh about citations. Need to be 
- Appearances signal values that people respond to. *How* do they do that is our main question?
 - The answers will usually be in reference to other appearances and values! Cest la vie! There is nothing at the bottom of everything. 


 - This class is about thinking and feeling. Both have to work together. Art, and artistic experience, is felt - but that feeling can be seen and examinde and talked about. FEeling without expression is just personal experience, not a paper. Thought without feeling is dry, and speculative. Artistic experience is *real* - and if you feel it, and can describe it, you describe something real. In this class, this is valued. But it has to be done well, and seriously.

Introduction slides:


Main areas of science that appear in this class:

Computer Science (of course)
Rhetoric
Psychology
Cultural analysis (see, Cyberpunk)
Music and film theory

Main big ideas in this class:
    + Randomness, Human Pattern-seeking behavior, noise, and chaos
    + Culture as something that is created and can be studied
    + The meanings of fantasy and sci-fi worlds, how they relate to our own
    + The beauty in instruments, devices, and things
    + The ways that everyday objects convey values through their design
    + Specific aesthetic categories: mechanical devices (machines), electronics, and machine decay
    + That concepts are "negotiable" - not definite, eternal ideas we must accept


This class is about thinking and feeling. Both have to work together. Art, and artistic experience, is felt - but that feeling can be seen and examinde and talked about. FEeling without expression is just personal experience, not a paper. Thought without feeling is dry, and speculative. Artistic experience is *real* - and if you feel it, and can describe it, you describe something real. In this class, this is valued. But it has to be done well, and seriously.

The big over-arching "rules":
Citations, above all else. Not optional.
    + This policy starts on day one. Or your college adventure will end early.
    + Play it safe and cite more than what is necessary. Cite your peers. Cite the classroom discussion. And, obviously, cite any other resources (books, etc.).


Content above form.
    + I am not grading you on your grammar and punctuation. You are graded based on your willingness to experiment with ideas. 
    + No summarizing is allowed. We all read the same stuff -we don't need it summarized for us. When you write, you want to focus on saying something new, however small, however subtle. A big idea comes to everyone sometimes. But you can always dig around and find a small idea, a little subtle thing, and nurture it. You can defend ideas carefully, and from many sides. All this makes for good writing that other people want to read. 

The objective vs the subjective. 
    + We tend to say things are objective which are true apart from our beliefs, and things are subjective which depend entirely on our beliefs. Many things are a mixture of both.
    + It's common to think that each person has their own preferences and beliefs, and that we should let each other do that. For one, it's not always true. But even when it is true, we can still enjoy and understand our preferences better when they're in dialogue (often, disagreement) with others. This is a class for friendly debate. 
    + Aesthetics is about discovering the objective in the subjective. For example, I think I like this music but I also understand that it uses certian audio techniques that predispose me to enjoy it. Is this neutral? Is it at least something I can dissect and discuss? Have I discovered an objective *aspect* of a subjective experience?
